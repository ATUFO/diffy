# Getting started
## Running the example
The downstream.sh and example.sh script included here build and launche example servers as well as a diffy instance.
1. Verify that ports 9000, 9100, 9200 are available and run `./example/downstream.sh`.
2. You have just built and deployed candidate(localhost:9000), primary(localhost:9100) and secondary(localhost:9200).
3. Now open another terminal and prepare to deploy Diffy.
4. Verify that the ports 8880 and 8888 are available and run `./example/run.sh start`.
5. You have just deployed Diffy UI(localhost:8888) and proxy(localhost:8880).

Once your local Diffy instance is deployed, you send it a few requests by running `./example/traffic.sh`.

You can now go to your browser at
[http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888) to see what the differences across our example instances look like.

## Digging deeper
That was cool but now you want to compare old and new versions of your own service. Hereâ€™s how you can
start using Diffy to compare three instances of your service:

1. Deploy your old code to `localhost:9990`. This is your primary.
2. Deploy your old code to `localhost:9991`. This is your secondary.
3. Deploy your new code to `localhost:9992`. This is your candidate.
4. Download the latest Diffy binary from maven central or build your own from the code using `mvn package`.
5. Create a YAML config file (let's call it diffy.yml) by copying and modifying the [default config file](/src/main/resources/application.yml).
6. Run the Diffy jar with following command line arguments:

    ```
    java -jar -Dspring.config.location=diffy.yml diffy.jar
    ```

7. Send a few test requests to your Diffy instance on its proxy port:

    ```
    curl localhost:8880/your/application/route?with=queryparams
    ```

8. Watch the differences show up in your browser at [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888).

9. By default the names of the resources in the UI are fetched from the `Canonical-Resource` header in each
request. However this can be configured at boot with a static line, example: 
```
-resource.mapping='/foo/:param;f,/b/*;b,/ab/*/g;g,/z/*/x/*/p;p' \
```
In the snippet above the configuration form is: `<pattern>;<resource-name>[,<pattern>;<resource-name>]*`

The first matching configuration will be used.

10. The ```responseMode``` flag can have one of 3 values - ```'primary'```, ```'secondary'```, or ```'candidate'```. The value assigned to this flag will determine which of the 3 response for any request sent to diffy will be returned to the client. If the flag is not explicitly assigned it defaults to ```'primary'```.

## Using Diffy with Docker

You can pull the [official docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/diffy/diffy/) with `docker pull diffy/diffy`

And run it with
```
docker run --env OTEL_JAVAAGENT_ENABLED=false -d --name diffy-01 \
  -p 8880:8880 -p 8888:8888 \
  diffy/diffy  env \
    --candidate=host.docker.internal:9000 \
    --master.primary=host.docker.internal:9100 \
    --master.secondary=host.docker.internal:9200 \
    --responseMode=primary \
    --service.protocol=http \
    --serviceName="Sample Service" \
    --proxy.port=8880 \
    --http.port=8888 \
    --rootUrl=localhost:8888
```

You should now be able to point to:
 - http://localhost:8888 to see the web interface
 - Use port 8880 to send your API traffic

*NOTE*: You can  pull the [sample service](https://hub.docker.com/r/diffy/example-service/) and deploy the `production` (primary, secondary) and `candidate` tags to start playing with diffy right away.

You can always build the image from source with `docker build -t diffy .`

## FAQ's
   For safety reasons `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, ` DELETE ` are ignored by default . Add ` --allowHttpSideEffects=true ` to your command line arguments to enable these verbs.
